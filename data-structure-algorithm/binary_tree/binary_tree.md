Binary tree is a special tree structure that have up to two child nodes: a left child node and a right child node. 

### Key concepts
**Node**: Nodes are the building blocks of a bianry tree. Each node contains data and pointers to its left and right children.  The data can be any kind of information such as number, character and even object. 

**Root Node**: The very top node in the tree is called root node. It has no parent node

**Child Node**: Child nodes connects to parent node one level below. As mentioned eailier, a binary tree enforces a maximum of two child nodes per parent

**Leaf node**: Those are the node at the end of branches with no child nodes


**Degree**: 

**Level**: 

###  Common Applications
- File Systems: Tree structures are often used in file systems to organize directories and subdirectories.
- Priority Queues: Binary trees can be used to implement priority queues where elements are retrieved based on their priority (higher priority elements are retrieved first).
- Syntax Trees: In computer programming, binary trees can represent the structure of code (like expressions) for parsing and evaluation.






Binary Search Tree(BST): BST is a special type of binary tree, where every left node's value is less than its parent's value, and every right node's value is greater than its parent's value. This tree is sorted, allowing for efficient search.
